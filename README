==================================

These modules were written for GRASS 6.4.* on Linux system to help me in geospatial work. 

To use these shell scripts just copy them to some catalog in your system PATH (or set GRASS_ADDON_PATH variable) and make them executable (as general, "chmod +x" in Unix-like systems). 

Scripts (I hope) have no "bashisms". If you find some errors, please, write me (amuriy AT gmail DOT com).
